    <p>Description</p>
    <p>Delicious and tender grilled chicken on a bed of lettuce, tomato and mayo sandwiched between two slices of toasted French bread. Bacon and provolone cheese can also be added to sandwiches.</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic and herb seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh dill, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>8 thick slices French bread</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat grill to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Prick chicken breasts all over with a fork. Place chicken breasts, 1/4 cup olive oil, white wine vinegar, lemon juice, garlic and herb seasoning, ground black pepper, and chopped fresh dill in a bowl. Stir to coat chicken breasts completely. Let stand for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken breasts from marinade, discard marinade, and grill chicken for 10 to 15 minutes on each side, or until juices run clear and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove from grill; let stand for 5 minutes. Cut chicken breasts in half.</li>
        <li>Melt butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle garlic powder and salt over butter and oil. Add French bread slices to the pan and toast until golden brown on one side, about 3 minutes; remove from pan.</li>
        <li>For sandwich assembly, place one slice of French bread with toasted side down onto a serving plate. Spread mayonnaise on bread; top with a slice of tomato, salt and ground black pepper to taste, half a grilled chicken breast, and lettuce. Spread untoasted side of another slice of bread with mayonnaise and place on top to make a sandwich.</li>
    </ol>
